# Optimising Barcelona Walks

Language: pyhton
Library used: osmnx

## Description 
I used osmnx library in order to get the Barcelona map in form of graph. Then I applied Dijkstra's Algorithm in orde to find the best walking route between any street of Barcelona. Moreover I added a fucnionality that prints the route you must follow to go from point A to point B.

## Result

For example, I decided that I want to go for a walk. The starting point will be "Avinguda Gaudí" as I am in the Sagrada Familia, and I want to go to "Plaça Espanya". The route proposed by the algorithm is the following one:
